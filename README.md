## Introduction

The aim of this project is to introduce the concept of inter-process communication using signals in Unix-based systems. The client sends a message to the server one character at a time, and the server receives and prints the message once it's complete.

## Features

- Simple client-server architecture
- Inter-process communication using signals
- Support for transmitting messages between client and server

## Installation

To install and run this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    https://github.com/Aminebouramtane/Minitalk.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd minitalk
    ```

3. Compile the server and client programs:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

## Usage

### Server

To run the server, execute the following command:
```sh
./server
```
The server will display its process ID (PID) upon startup and wait for messages from the client.

### Client


To send a message to the server, execute the following command:
```sh
./client [SERVER_PID] [MESSAGE]
```
Replace [SERVER_PID] with the process ID of the server displayed when it started, and [MESSAGE] with the string you want to send

### Example:
```sh
./client 12345 "Hello, world!"
```
